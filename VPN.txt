1. Choose a reputable free VPN service
Examples: ProtonVPN, Windscribe,(all have free plans).
Avoid unknown or suspicious VPNs — some log data or inject ads.

2. Download and install the VPN client
Go to the official website only (never third-party download sites).
Install the client for your OS (Windows, Mac, Linux) or mobile device.

3. Connect to a VPN server
Choose the closest location for faster speeds.
If you want to bypass location restrictions, pick a server in the target country.

4. Verify your IP address has changed
Visit whatismyipaddress.com or ipleak.net.
Check that your IP and location are different from your actual one.

5. Browse a website to confirm encryption
Open any website.
Use Wireshark or browser developer tools to confirm HTTPS + VPN encryption.

6. Disconnect VPN and compare speed & IP
Re-check your IP — it should return to your real one.
Compare browsing speed (VPN might be slightly slower).

7. Research VPN encryption & privacy features
Common protocols: OpenVPN, IKEv2, WireGuard.
Features to note: Kill switch, No-log policy, DNS leak protection.
